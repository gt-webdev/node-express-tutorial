# node-express-tutorial

This is the code for the GT WebDev Node/Express Tutorial in the Fall of 2021. In the complete folder, you'll find the complete, working code. If you want to follow along with the video tutorial, you can find go to try-it folder and add code as you watch along. The steps are also enumerated in the instructions file.

## Stuff to Download
You'll need to download Node.js, and if you would like to download Postman to test out your API, you'll need to download that as well. You can download Node.js at this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/, and you can download Postman at this link: https://www.postman.com/downloads/.

## Installing Dependencies
If you're running into "ModuleNotFound" errors while trying to run the Node.js server, that probably means that you need to run the command ```npm install``` to download all of your dependencies (libraries you're importing). If that still doesn't work, you may need install a library manually with ```npm install moduleName```, where ```moduleName``` is the name of the module you are trying to install.

## Running and Terminating the API
You can run the API by going to the completed code with the terminal command ```cd complete/server``` and running ```node index.js```. You can close the server by simply clicking Command-C in the terminal shell.
